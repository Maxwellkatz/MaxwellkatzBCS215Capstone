#=========================================================================
#So far, for my project i have gotten done with the welcome screen,and the main menu, along with the exit feature for it
#I dont have any issues currently with my project, but i think i will have some once i begin implementing features
#I plan to work on the listing patients first, because once that is out of the way, then i ca do adding, searching, and deleting more easily
